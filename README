NAME
    pcull - kill or renice processes that are overusing resources

SYNOPSIS
    pcull [--daemonize --loop --log-file=/SOME/FILE] [--debug --pretend]

DESCRIPTION
    This scripts takes action on processes that exceed resource limits defined 
    in its configuration file, /etc/pcull/pcull.conf by default.  Currently, it 
    renices processes that use too much CPU for a relatively short time, kills 
    processes that use too much CPU for a relatively long time, and kills 
    processes that use too much memory.  The culling does not kick in unless 
    load avg or free memory are above/below the thresholds specified in the 
    configuration file.  CPU-intensive jobs are also given a short grace period 
    before being reniced, again set in the configuration file.  When this 
    script takes culling actions, e-mail is sent to the affected user and any 
    other users specified in the configuration file.

    The files /etc/pcull/exempt_users and /etc/pcull/exempt_processes can be 
    used to specify users and processes (as regular expressions) that are to be 
    exempt from culling.  The root user is automatically exempt.  The files 
    /etc/pcull/*_subject.sh and /etc/pcull/*_body.sh are scripts that build the 
    subject and body of emails that are sent out.  See the comments in those 
    files for more details.

    The base configuration directory, /etc/pcull by default, is actually 
    computed relative to the location of the pcull script.

    The following call will run pcull once and simply print to stderr the 
    actions it would take:
    
        pcull --pretend --debug
    
    The following call will run pcull forever in the background, renicing 
    and killing jobs that exceed resource limits:
        
        pcull --daemonize --loop --log-file=/var/log/pcull
    
    The rpm package of this script provides an init script which can be used to 
    control pcull running in looping, daemonized mode.  Any arguments passed to 
    start are passed on to the pcull script.  By default, the init script will 
    configure pcull to write its log to /var/log/pcull.log.
 
OPTIONS
    --pretend
        only write to the log, don't take any real action
    
    --debug
        write extra verbose information to the log
    
    --log-file
        path of where to write log messages; must be an absolute path; default 
        is /dev/stderr
    
    --daemonize
        detach from the terminal, run in the background, etc.
    
    --loop
        execute forever in a loop; see configuration file option LOOP_INTERVAL
    
    -h, --help
        print this help and exit
    
KNOWN BUGS
    One SIGHUP will cause the script to properly reload the configuration, but 
    further SIGHUPs appear to be ignored.
